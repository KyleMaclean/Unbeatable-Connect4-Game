This script allows a human to play interactively against an AI which uses the minimax algorithm to determine its next move. The AI will specifically choose the shortest path (fewest moves) to a win for itself but if it cannot find a winning path, it will choose the longest.

The `.lhs` file contains the code with detailed explanatory comments and test cases; the `.hs` file contains just the code.
